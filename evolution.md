## Building our Visual Language

Rather than rush into making a logo we want to explore the feel for what we plan to do.

Foods I Adore is a range of quality product presented by a prominent chef or a well
known person excited about food and quality.

Values that we want to reflect,

* Authentic and Honest
* Quality Raw Materials
* Opinionated

## First step, explore design elements

Midtone backgrounds to signal the different areas on the site.
Typefaces for FIA, chefs, heading, regular text.

For the typefaces existing webfonts and the conversion of other to webfonts should be considered.

If possible symbol fonts should be used as graphic elements on the website. I.E. [Pictos](http://pictos.drewwilson.com/) or [Kfon](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Kfon).

An important element is the chef introduction like "Jason Atherton for Foods I Adore",
but it is by no means the only part to explore.

## Physical Packaging

We generally source existing food products and use most of the existing packaging.
Our design elements will be gradually introduced into the packaging as the product
proves its long term viability.

## Website

The website will be composed of several areas,

* Food Blogging
* Timeline of Video Clips / Stills
* Personal Web Shop
* Community pages

The elements should cover pages of a light and midtone background. As pictures will be
part of the content the base design will use images sparingly. An important element
is how to combine text and pictures posted on the site.
